				&nbsp &nbsp <strong> The Ulhas River </strong> originates in a valley located to the north of Rajmachi hills formed by mountain streams.The northern slopes of these hills which are a part of Sahyadri Ranges of Western Ghats is drained by this river. It then enters Thane and Raigad districts of Maharashtra between Kulgaon-Badlapur towards north of Ulhasnagar and then moves towards Kalyan. Then the river turns in west direction towards Thane and gets connected in to Thane creek. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&nbsp &nbsp During its course it discharges water of Barvi Dam. At Thane , it seperates into two, of which one branch flows in west direction while the other flows in south direction.
			</p>
			<p>
				&nbsp &nbsp The river then turns in North-West direction towards Godbunder, where it opens into an estuary known as Vasai Creek. The Thane creek empties into Bombay harbour.
