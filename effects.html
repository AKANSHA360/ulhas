				&nbsp &nbsp	Increased human activity, unnecessary dumping of waste in rivers, release of untreated harmful effluents from factories into river has led to contamination of water causing water pollution. Due to this the rivers are highly impacted making them unsafe for use.

				<p>&nbsp &nbsp <strong>Ganga river</strong> is considered to be one of the purest river in India. It is also described to be as <strong>sacred</strong> since its' purity is believed to wash the sins of the faithful and aid the dead on their path towards heaven. Ganga River known as Ganga Maata or Mother Ganges is revered as a goddess.<br>
					&nbsp &nbsp Still, it is a sad truth that the condition of the same river is degrading day-by-day. And the worst part is that the same people who call River Ganga as goddess are responsible for it.Today Ganga is considered to be the sixth most polluted river in India. Since Ganga is considered to be sacred, a lot of rituals are been carried on its' Ghats. Daily a lot of people perform pujas on the Ghats of River Ganga and at the same time immerse the ritualistic materials into the river as a part of their tradition. This has become the main source of pollution of River Ganga. <br>
					&nbsp &nbsp Also everyday people in large numbers gather on the Ghats of ganga to carry their morning rituals and take bath in river Ganga which has also contributed to the pollution. According to Hindu tradition, after death the humans are cremated on the Ghats of River Ganga. During Kumbh Mela lakhs and lakhs of people gather on the banks of river Ganga and take bath, carry rituals, perform pujas on the ghats of River Ganga. This has contributed to the pollution of River Ganga in large number.

					&nbsp &nbsp Only about 2% of the effluents released from industries is been treated properly before letting off in the river while others are released without proper treatment directly into River Ganga.
					This has led to accumulation of harmful and poisonous chemicals in the river thereby decreasing its' oxygen content and leading to increase in pollution. This has even led to formation of poisonous foam in the river.

					&nbsp &nbsp <strong>Yamuna river</strong> which is the main source of water for Delhi is one of the most polluted rivers of the country. The pollution levels here have increased by a large extent thereby increasing the toxicity of water. 2% Yamuna stretch accounts for 76% of water pollution. <br>
					&nbsp &nbsp Only 2% of the industrial and domestic waste is been treated before letting off in the river resulting in increased levels of water pollution. Due to continuous human activity, performing rituals on the banks of Yamuna river, carrying pujas near Yamuna river, immersion of flowers, diyas and other ritualistic materials in river Yamuna, water pollution has increased by a large extent. Also cremation of humans after their death according to Hindu tradition has contributed to the increasing pollution.

					&nbsp &nbsp Due to industrial waste, accumulation of heavy metals such as lead, chromium, aresnic and mercury has taken place which has led to formation of toxic foam in River Yamuna. The pollution levels have gone beyond control and it has become quite necessary to take necessary measures so as to reduce them.

					&nbsp &nbsp <strong>Ulhas River</strong> is one of the most polluted rivers of the state of Maharashtra. A research shows that Ulhas River which is the main source of drinking water for the cities of Ulhasnagar, Badlapur, Kalyan, Dombivli and Navi Mumbai has became unfit for drinking purposes and hazardous for human health. This water is supplied to more than 30 lakh residents of the area.

				<p>
					&nbsp &nbsp Industrial waste, human waste, animal waste, plant waste has contributed to the pollution of Ulhas River. As a result, a green cover of algae, fungii, weed can be seen over the river water. The pollution levels have increased so much that sometimes a foul smell arises from river. According to Hindu tradition after any rituals or pujas, the materials left are been immmersed into river water which leads to accumulation of waste in water thereby polluting it. Also the industrial wastes are been released into the river without proper treatment. People also wash their animals and themselves have bath in the river. All these has led to increase in water pollution by a large extent.
