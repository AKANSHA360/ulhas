				&nbsp &nbsp Cleanliness Drive was even organised at the Ghats of Yamuna River by Delhi Government with an aim to rejenuvate River Yamuna. Many people took active participation in the programme and extended their support towards cleaning River Yamuna. <br>
				<br>
				&nbsp &nbsp As a responsible citizen even we need to contribute on our part. It can be done in many ways.

			<div class="prevention">
				<p>
					&nbsp &nbsp Inspite of immersing the flowers, coconut and all the other ritualistic materials in river water, we must keep them in pots kept near temples or rivers. From these pots, these things are taken and are used for creating fertilizers, manure, etc. Hence it can be re-used thereby helping reduce the pollution. Adopting this technique can help reduce major amount of garbage from rivers.<br>
					<br>
					&nbsp &nbsp People must be given education regarding the importance of rivers so that they can stop carrying their morning rituals, washing clothes, taking their animals to bath near river water which also accounts for major part of pollution. Awareness campaigns must be organised and strict actons must be taken regarding people breaking the rules. Use of plastic must be completely banned and instead cloth bags must be used to stop collection of garbage at one place and avoid water blocking.

				<p>
					&nbsp &nbsp Cleanliness Dives must be organised atleast once a week and people must be encouraged to actively participate in such drives. Just as said <strong> "Rome was not built in a day" </strong> similarly we cannot change the current scenario of rivers in a day. We definitely need to join hands and come together because together we can make a change and gradually help our rivers get back to what it must be-clean, pollution-free and safe for everyone.
